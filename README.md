## Introduction

Driver churn represents one of the most critical challenges facing ride-sharing platforms today. When drivers leave Lyft, the ripple effects extend far beyond a simple headcount reduction. Increased rider wait times erode customer satisfaction, reduced market liquidity weakens competitive positioning, and ultimately, revenue suffers as both supply and demand dynamics decline.

At Lyft, this challenge demanded a sophisticated analytical approach — one that could not only identify which drivers were at risk of churning but also understand the underlying behavioral patterns driving their decisions. This project represents a comprehensive effort to transform raw driver activity data into actionable retention strategies.
